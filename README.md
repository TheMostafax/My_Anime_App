<h4 align="left">1. The app is still in the development phase and is not yet finished.</h4>
<h4 align="left">2. Currently, I am focusing on improving the categories and favorite mechanism of the app to provide a more seamless and user-friendly experience for our users. By optimizing these features, we aim to make it easier for users to find and save their favorite anime shows, and to streamline the checkout process for any premium content. Our goal is to ensure that users can enjoy their anime watching experience with as little friction as possible.</h4>
